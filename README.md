<h3 align="center">A ‚Äúaspromautic‚Äù icons themes for dark environments</h3>

These aspromautic or monochromatic icons are based on Andrea Bonnani's [Suru++ [Minimal]](https://github.com/Magog64/SURU-PLUS) icons of sizes 16, 24 and 32. It is flat, minimalist and designed for dark environments. 

The word "Aspr√≥mauros" comes from the modern Greek word *Œ±œÉœÄœÅœåŒºŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ*, which means *black and white*.

## Known bugs

### Some icons are not correctly applied in some apps

Some apps, as AppImage-buit, Flatpak-built, Snap-built and dpkg-installed apps do not use the relative path of an icon. They use the absolute path of an icon, preventing the icon of being correctly applied. Besides, some apps misuse the icon name, for example, GitHub Desktop uses the icon name called `Icon=desktop`.

We provide desktop files (AppImage, native Debian packages, snap app and source codes) for you for being able of applying correctly the icons. You can download them from the repository  <a href="https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus/tree/master/desktop">Suru++</a>. Copy them to `your_name/local/applications/`, so they won't be reverted to original when you make next updates of Ubuntu and/or PPAs.

We recommend you to back your desktop configuration files up when you intend to make a clean install or reinstall your distribution.
