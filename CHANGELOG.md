# v3.0 – Βαρκινών

The version 3.0 is named after Βαρκινών (Barkinón in Greek), in tribute to Barcelona, because of Suru++ 30 version named after Barcelona. Βαρκινών is a old name of Barcelona, which was used to be inhabited by Ionic Greek immigrants, which founded the state-city of Empórion (Ἐμπόριον). These immigrants came from Phocaea, which used to belong to the kingdom of Mycenaeans. In the Greek Dark Ages, Phocaea, as part of Aegean Islands, which where capital of geometric art and poetry, became important for the black-and-white geometric art brought to Hispania by that time.
